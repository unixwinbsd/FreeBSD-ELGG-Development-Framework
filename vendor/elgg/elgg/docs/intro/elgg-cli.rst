elgg-cli command line tools
===========================

Depending on how you installed Elgg and your server configuration you can access``elgg-cli`` binaries as one of the following 
from the root of your Elgg installation:

.. code-block:: sh

    php ./elgg-cli list
    ./elgg-cli list
    php ./vendor/bin/elgg-cli list
    ./vendor/bin/elgg-cli list

.. note::

	Be advised that when using elgg-cli it might be needed to run the command as the same user as the webserver to prevent issues with rights related to files.

Adding custom commands
======================

Plugins can add their commands to the CLI application, by adding command class name via a configuration in ``elgg-plugin.php`` or via the ``'commands','cli'`` event.
Command class must extend ``\Elgg\CLI\Command``.

.. code-block:: php

    class MyCommand extends \Elgg\Ð¡li\Command {

    }

    elgg_register_event_handler('commands', 'cli', function(\Elgg\Event $event) {
        $return = $event->getValue();

        $return[] = MyCommand::class;

        return $return;

    });

Custom commands are based on `Symfony Console Commands`_. Please refer to their documentation for more details.
