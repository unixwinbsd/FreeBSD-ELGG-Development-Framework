Changes in the DOM structure
----------------------------

In order to improve accessibility the HTML DOM structure has been changed slightly. Some sections of the page have been
changed from a ``div`` to ``header``, ``main`` or ``footer``. The classes or place in the DOM has not been changed.

Deprecated Views
----------------

 * ``page/elements/<section>/after`` is deprecated: Extend the correct ``page/elements/<section>``
 * ``page/elements/<section>/before`` is deprecated: Prepend the correct ``page/elements/<section>``
 * ``resources/comments/edit`` is deprecated: This resource is no longer in use

Deprecated Routes
-----------------

 * ``edit:object:comment`` is deprecated: Editing comments uses an inline form
